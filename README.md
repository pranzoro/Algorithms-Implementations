# Algorithms-Implementations
Implementations of various algorithms in C++, using Object Oriented Programming.
The algorithms implemented in the codes attached above include finding Strongly Connected Components in a directed graph (using Kosaraju's Algorithm), finding the Topological Sorting of a given directed graph, detect a cycle in a graph (using DFS), finding maximum sum of weights in a path of weighted DAG (using DP), generating Fibonacci Numbers by using Strassen's Matrix Multiplication, find the primes within a range by using Segmented Sieve.
